***Android*** is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.

***Android*** is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance and commercially sponsored by Google.

It is free and open source software; its source code is known as ***Android Open Source Project (AOSP)***, which is primarily licensed under the Apache License. However most ***Android*** devices ship with additional proprietary software pre-installed, most notably ***Google Mobile Services (GMS)*** which includes core apps such as Google Chrome, the digital distribution platform Google Play and associated Google Play Services development platform.

The source code has been used to develop variants of ***Android*** on a range of other electronics, such as ***<u>game consoles, digital cameras, portable media players, PCs and others</u>***, each with a specialized user interface. Some well known derivatives include ***<u>Android TV</u>*** for televisions and ***<u>Wear OS</u>*** for wearables, both developed by Google. Software packages on ***Android***, which use the ***<u>APK format</u>***, are generally distributed through proprietary application stores like ***Google Play Store***, ***Samsung Galaxy Store***, and ***Huawei AppGallery***, or open source platforms like ***Aptoide*** or ***F-Droid***.
